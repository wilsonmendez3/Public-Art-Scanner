The energy and monumentality of the figure in red chalk, whose body extends beyond the sheet, suggests the heroic athleticism of Michelangelo’s sculpture.</td>\n",

During the Renaissance, small bronzes were kept in cabinets, bringing the gods and goddesses of ancient times into the home. Flaws in the bronze casting suggest that this piece is from the early Renaissance. In 1971, Ulrich Middeldorf rejected Olga Raggio's original attribution to an anonymous Florentine, attributing it instead to the sixteenth-century Sienese artist Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501), based partly on its resemblance to Francesco's bronze angels in Siena's Duomo. However, such details as the awkward posture and frozen motion of the body relate this work more closely to Francesco's pupil Giacomo Cozzarelli (1453-1515). Standing Figure of a Man is attributed to the circle of Francesco di Giorgio Martini, as uncertainties remain regarding its exact author.</td>\n",

In contrast to the other work, the faces of the Madonna and Child are significantly less expressive, and the passages of exposed skin have been left unglazed.  The Madonna holds a nude Christ on her left arm and wears a mantle of blue with green lining and a maroon tunic with a yellow collar and cuffs.  Her bright yellow shoes and the purple of her tunic are characteristic of Buglioni's color scheme and can also be seen in the other work.  The tabernacle frame is probably contemporary to the figures, although it may not have been created specifically for this altarpiece.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Andrea della Robbia, where he would have studied the family's techniques for glazing terracotta.  The frame is classically inspired, with Corinthian capitals and Buglioni's characteristic egg and dart moldings.  The facial type in this Madonna and Child recalls Buglioni's Madonna delle Grazie in Florence's Palazzo Frescobaldi, and because of this similarity, the scholar Allan Marquand attributed the Cleveland Madonna and Child to Buglioni in 1921, although this attribution has since been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009</td>\n",

Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bacchanale\\r\\nDuring a visit to London in 1910, Malvina Hoffman attended two performances by the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova (1882-1931). The program included the \"Autumn Bacchanale\" section of The Seasons by Aleksandr Glazunov (1865-1936), which Pavlova danced with her partner, Mikhail Mordkin. A spirited and erotic work, the \"Bacchanale\" was inspired by the legendary followers of Bacchus (Dionysus in Greek), the ancient god of wine. The piece featured the two dancers dashing about the stage, their movements accented by veils of floating gauze. Hoffman later recalled being struck by \"impressions of motion of a new kind, of dazzling vivacity and spontaneity and yet with a control that could come only from long discipline and dedication.\" \\r\\nIn 1912 Hoffman modeled a 14-inch composition of Pavlova and Mordkin called Bacchanale Russe (Russian Bacchanale). The smiling dancers were shown nude, holding a billowing scarf above their heads, as they made their entrance on stage. It took six weeks of modeling sessions to complete the composition. Hoffman wrote to her sister: \"I have never had such a difficult problem-it's awful---I pray I may never be seized with the desire to fit two flying creatures together...again. If you could see the antics that go on, trying to get my two models to take the pose together!\"\\r\\nNine bronze casts were made of the original version during Hoffman's lifetime. In 1917 two casts were produced in a larger, nearly six-foot size. One was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where it was destroyed during the German Occupation of Paris in World War II. The other found a home in the garden of the Henry G. Dalton house on Lake Shore Boulevard in Bratenahl, Ohio. It was given to the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1943. Vibrant with life, the two figures demonstrate Hoffman's ability to capture a fleeting moment of the dance in tangible, permanent form, without sacrificing the rhythmic flow of live movement.\\r\\nThe Sculptor and the Dancer\\r\\nHoffman did not actually meet Anna Pavlova until 1914, four years after she first saw the dancer perform. The two women developed a warm friendship, with Pavlova encouraging Hoffman to attend rehearsals and make sketches from the wings during performances. \\r\\nThey also collaborated, until Pavlova's death in 1931, on a long-term endeavor---a frieze of relief panels depicting the highpoints of the entire \"Bacchanale\" in sequence. Pavlova posed for the panels with partners Laurent Novikov and Alexander Volinine, but for Hoffman that was not enough. She prepared herself for the project by learning the entire dance herself and performing it with Pavlova's assistant partner, Andreas Pavley.\\r\\nFrom New York to Paris\\r\\nThe daughter of English concert pianist Richard Hoffman, Malvina Hoffman grew up in New York City. Her artistic training began with drawing and painting, but after studying at the Art Students League and receiving helpful criticism from sculptors Herbert Adams (1858-1945) and Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), she decided to concentrate on sculpture. Traveling to Europe in 1910, she studied with Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) in Paris. To provide herself with a solid foundation in the art and craft of sculpture she took courses in dissection at the Cornell College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York and also learned the technology of casting, chasing, and patinating bronze. \\r\\nHoffman's interest in the ballet did not preclude production of works dealing with other subjects. She completed several public monuments and numerous portraits, which earned her an international reputation and led to her most ambitious project: the 1929 commission from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History for more than 100 life-size figures, heads, and busts representing the peoples of the earth.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This plaquette by Moderno, a Northern Italian sculptor active in the early 1500s, displays the ancient subject of Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion. The subject of this plaquette finds its origins in the ancient myth of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, a popular theme during the Renaissance. After killing his wife and child in a fit of rage, Hercules was sent by an oracle to be punished by King Eurystheus of Tiryns. The King presented Hercules with twelve challenges, the first of which was to kill the Nemean lion. Twice as large as a normal lion, it had an impenetrable hide, symbolic of the uncontrollability of nature. Hercules tracked the lion to its cave, and after failing to kill it with the arrows of Apollo, Hercules strangled the lion with his bare hands. As Hercules' strength allowed him to defeat the lion, the myth expresses human dominance over nature. Hercules then used the lion's razor-sharp claws to remove its skin and returned to King Eurystheus wearing the impenetrable skin as protection. To honor the lion's struggle against Hercules, Zeus transformed the lion into the constellation Leo. In this scene, the nude Hercules stands in profile facing left with his left foot resting on the plaquette's lower border. The plaquette has no background other than a barren tree against which rest Hercules's club and Apollo's quiver and bow. The lion rests its rear paw on Hercules' thigh as Hercules lifts the lion off of the ground. The lion's body and mane consists of stylized tufts of fur which contrast with the smooth, naturalistic form of Hercules' body. The minute, short curling lines of the hair and mane create a rhythmic effect while the smooth curves of the forms place an emphasis on contour-this contrast of visual rhythm with smooth form is in fact characteristic of Moderno's bronze relief sculpture. The composition meanwhile has its origin in ancient Greek coins as well as Renaissance cameos.</td>\n",

This small bronze is likely a sculptural representation of the Wrath of Neptune from the Aeneid. During the Trojan War, Juno incited winds to sink Trojan ships. Infuriated by Juno's incursion into his domain of the sea, Neptune rides out in his chariot, saving the Trojan army and threatening to punish the winds for their insolence. The massive, muscular nude male figure stands upright on his seahorse-drawn chariot, twisting to face the wind. The turbulent waves and the windblown hair and beard of the figure give life to this small bronze. The figure's left hand would have originally held reins, while the right hand, which once held a trident, is outstretched in the act of commanding the waves to be still. This bronze was once attributed by art historian Wilhelm von Bode to Jacopo Sansovino based on its similarity to known works, such as the over-life-size marble figure of Neptune of the Scala di Giganti outside of the Doge's Palace in Venice. However, by 1921 Leo Planiscig had noted the CMA Neptune's similarity to bronzes and reliefs by Sansovino's pupil, Tiziano Minio, in the Loggetta at San Marco Square, Venice. In Minio's Jupiter on the Island of Candia for the Loggetta, the waves are represented with the same incised, undulating grooves as in this work. Neptune possesses the same stocky proportions and heavy musculature which was characteristic of Minio. The high polish and sweeping contours of the figure are characteristic of Sansovino, but the heightened drama of the subject display Minio's stylistic advancement from his teacher.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Born in 1744, Anne Vallayer-Coster was a prominent still-life painter in France during the 1770s and 1780s. The daughter of a goldsmith, she grew up observing the intricacies of metalwork, acquiring an attention to detail apparent in her paintings. She was apprenticed to the seascape painter Joseph Vernet who encouraged her to pursue painting as a profession. In 1770 Vallayer-Coster sought membership in the exclusive French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture with the submission of two still-life paintings, \"The Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture\" and \"The Attributes of Music.\" She was accepted with full rights and privileges to the overwhelmingly male academy-the only woman to be granted membership during this period independent of royal support or ties to a male academician. Denis Diderot, a French art critic and philosopher, responded to her submissions: \"It is certain that if all new members made a showing like Mademoiselle Vallayer's, and sustained the same high level of quality there, the Salon would look very different!\" Since women were officially barred during the 18th century from studying the male nude from life, still-life painting was among the few genres open to female painters. Garnering a reputation as a beautiful socialite who possessed the painting skills usually ascribed to male history painters, she was the only woman to enjoy the honor of lodging in the Louvre under the invitation of Marie Antoinette, who greatly admired her work. Marie Antoinette herself was present at the artist's 1781 marriage to Jean-Pierre-Silvestre Coster in the halls of Versailles. Despite the close associations with Antoinette and her administration, Vallayer-Coster survived the French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror in 1793. Many of her patrons were not so fortunate, and the artist's production virtually stopped until 1804, when François Dumont painted this miniature. During this period, Vallayer-Coster struggled to reestablish herself among the elite of Paris. Over the course of 1804, she exhibited two works at the Salon and had two works commissioned by Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Dumont's miniature depicts Vallayer-Coster holding a paintbrush in her right hand and a vase with flowers in her left, clearly an allusion to her skill as a still-life painter. Perhaps Vallayer-Coster requested that Dumont portray her as an artist in order to reassert her status as an important still-life painter. She may have intended to give the miniature to the empress in gratitude for her commissions and in the hope that there would be more to come. Her last major work, \"Still Life with Lobster\", was given to Louis XVIII and displayed at the Salon in 1817. Vallayer-Coster died in 1818 at the age of 74. Dumont worked closely with Marie Antoinette and, like Vallayer-Coster, grappled with diminished patronage after the queen's death and years of revolution. He attempted to reestablish his practice during the reigns of the Bourbon kings Louis XVIII and Charles X, but the competition provided by miniaturists like Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767-1855) proved too strong. Dumont's exquisite portrait of Vallayer-Coster was produced during a time when both artist and sitter had fallen from the limelight and were struggling to prove their enduring relevance in the new regime.

To remedy the problem, the platforms and retaining walls were to be raised at the most dangerous spots. The Cours de Vincennes, in the eastern part of Paris, had been one of the deadliest intersections. The work on an elevated railway bridge over this street, which is depicted here, was completed in February 1889. Trouillebert concentrated on portraits until about 1881, when he began to focus on landscapes. He also painted everyday scenes and nudes.

While in Paris during the late 1920s, his association with artists of the Surrealist movement helped shape his sensibilities. Alluding to that movement, Hellebrand made reference to the eye-a recurrent symbol in Surrealist art-by cropping one side of the sitter's face. She emphasized Brandt's surroundings as a means of identifying his artistic and intellectual pursuits. Although positioned at the edge of the image, the sitter's placement at the forefront and Hellebrand's use of intense light and shadow produced a wonderful field of depth.

       "      <td>Since the great majority of Rembrandt's works are portraits or depictions of biblical and mythological subjects, human figures are an important element of his oeuvre. During the course of a long career Rembrandt produced nine etchings of nudes, conducting a searching analysis of the feminine form. Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background. Its beauty is further enhanced by the beige-toned Japanese paper, which adds warmth and a special glow to the flesh. Understandably, this superb impression once belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire and Chatsworth, who formed one of the finest old master print collections still in private hands.</td>\n",

Increasing her distinction, the flying male nudes personify Victory and Fame, while the crown indicates her nobility. The contrast in technique between the cartouche and the portrait was purposefully emphasized to suggest that the portrait is an older \"icon\" of reverence. The finished quality of the drawing suggests that it was a presentation sheet and not a study for a work of art in another medium. Giuseppe Cades was an important history painter and frescoist, known also for his decorative ensembles. He worked mostly in Rome in a neoclassical style based on Renaissance and ancient Roman art. This drawing combines the contemporary rococo style of the red chalk portrait with the antique-based style of the surrounding decorative figures and forms.</td>\n",

       "0    This drawing depicts Picasso's lover Fernande Olivier, with whom he spent the summer of 1906 in the remote Spanish village of Gósol, where he made this sheet. Picasso was engaged in radical experimentation with technique and simplified formal distortions at this time, and this shift in his work can be seen in Fernande's stylized face and somewhat disjointed gesture, and in the expressive strokes and spotted effects of the gouache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "10   This seated nude comes from a series of red chalk drawings that Baccio Bandinelli based loosely on Michelangelo's <em>ignudi</em> (nudes) on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–12). <em>Seated Male Nude</em> is a finished work of art: the forms have precise outlines and are filled in with painstaking hatching that renders the figure in careful relief. One of the most important Italian sculptors of the 1500s, Bandinelli considered drawing his primary strength. His drawings were prized both during and after his lifetime by his many admirers and students (he opened one of the first drawing academies of Renaissance Italy).

       "410  This small devotional object differs stylistically from Buglioni's Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Anthony Abbot (1921.1180), also in the museum's collection.  In contrast to the other work, the faces of the Madonna and Child are significantly less expressive, and the passages of exposed skin have been left unglazed.  The Madonna holds a nude Christ on her left arm and wears a mantle of blue with green lining and a maroon tunic with a yellow collar and cuffs.  Her bright yellow shoes and the purple of her tunic are characteristic of Buglioni's color scheme and can also be seen in the other work.  The tabernacle frame is probably contemporary to the figures, although it may not have been created specifically for this altarpiece.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Andrea della Robbia, where he would have studied the family's techniques for glazing terracotta.  The frame is classically inspired, with Corinthian capitals and Buglioni's characteristic egg and dart moldings.  The facial type in this Madonna and Child recalls Buglioni's Madonna delle Grazie in Florence's Palazzo Frescobaldi, and because of this similarity, the scholar Allan Marquand attributed the Cleveland Madonna and Child to Buglioni in 1921, although this attribution has since been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "412  These gilt bronze putti, or figures of plump male children in the nude, are near mirror images of one another.  Both are seated, with their arms flung to the side.  Minimal detailing exists in the hands and feet, with the fingers and toes signified only by simple line indentations.  The function and original placement of the putti is uncertain, but their posture and the placement of their hands suggest that originally they may have been placed in a larger statue group, perhaps holding either side of a banner, or even a piece of furniture.  A will drawn up by Guglielmo della Porta in 1558 mentions the existence of bronze Passion scenes and crucifixes, suggesting that the artist may have created other small bronze groups as well.  John Pope-Hennessey attributed these works to della Porta based on their similarity to the figures of Apollo and Artemis in Latona and her Children (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) and the monumental putti in his Tomb of Cardinal Paolo Cesi in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, although more recent research points away from della Porta as the maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "416  This plaquette by Moderno, a Northern Italian sculptor active in the early 1500s, displays the ancient subject of Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion. The subject of this plaquette finds its origins in the ancient myth of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, a popular theme during the Renaissance. After killing his wife and child in a fit of rage, Hercules was sent by an oracle to be punished by King Eurystheus of Tiryns. The King presented Hercules with twelve challenges, the first of which was to kill the Nemean lion. Twice as large as a normal lion, it had an impenetrable hide, symbolic of the uncontrollability of nature. Hercules tracked the lion to its cave, and after failing to kill it with the arrows of Apollo, Hercules strangled the lion with his bare hands. As Hercules' strength allowed him to defeat the lion, the myth expresses human dominance over nature. Hercules then used the lion's razor-sharp claws to remove its skin and returned to King Eurystheus wearing the impenetrable skin as protection. To honor the lion's struggle against Hercules, Zeus transformed the lion into the constellation Leo. In this scene, the nude Hercules stands in profile facing left with his left foot resting on the plaquette's lower border. The plaquette has no background other than a barren tree against which rest Hercules's club and Apollo's quiver and bow. The lion rests its rear paw on Hercules' thigh as Hercules lifts the lion off of the ground. The lion's body and mane consists of stylized tufts of fur which contrast with the smooth, naturalistic form of Hercules' body. The minute, short curling lines of the hair and mane create a rhythmic effect while the smooth curves of the forms place an emphasis on contour-this contrast of visual rhythm with smooth form is in fact characteristic of Moderno's bronze relief sculpture. The composition meanwhile has its origin in ancient Greek coins as well as Renaissance cameos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "417  These gilt bronze putti, or figures of plump male children in the nude, are near mirror images of one another.  Both are seated, with their arms flung to the side.  Minimal detailing exists in the hands and feet, with the fingers and toes signified only by simple line indentations.  The function and original placement of the putti is uncertain, but their posture and the placement of their hands suggest that originally they may have been placed in a larger statue group, perhaps holding either side of a banner, or even a piece of furniture.  A will drawn up by Guglielmo della Porta in 1558 mentions the existence of bronze Passion scenes and crucifixes, suggesting that the artist may have created other small bronze groups as well.  John Pope-Hennessey attributed these works to della Porta based on their similarity to the figures of Apollo and Artemis in Latona and her Children (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) and the monumental putti in his Tomb of Cardinal Paolo Cesi in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, although more recent research points away from della Porta as the maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "431  Born in 1744, Anne Vallayer-Coster was a prominent still-life painter in France during the 1770s and 1780s. The daughter of a goldsmith, she grew up observing the intricacies of metalwork, acquiring an attention to detail apparent in her paintings. She was apprenticed to the seascape painter Joseph Vernet who encouraged her to pursue painting as a profession. In 1770 Vallayer-Coster sought membership in the exclusive French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture with the submission of two still-life paintings, \"The Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture\" and \"The Attributes of Music.\" She was accepted with full rights and privileges to the overwhelmingly male academy-the only woman to be granted membership during this period independent of royal support or ties to a male academician. Denis Diderot, a French art critic and philosopher, responded to her submissions: \"It is certain that if all new members made a showing like Mademoiselle Vallayer's, and sustained the same high level of quality there, the Salon would look very different!\" Since women were officially barred during the 18th century from studying the male nude from life, still-life painting was among the few genres open to female painters. Garnering a reputation as a beautiful socialite who possessed the painting skills usually ascribed to male history painters, she was the only woman to enjoy the honor of lodging in the Louvre under the invitation of Marie Antoinette, who greatly admired her work. Marie Antoinette herself was present at the artist's 1781 marriage to Jean-Pierre-Silvestre Coster in the halls of Versailles. Despite the close associations with Antoinette and her administration, Vallayer-Coster survived the French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror in 1793. Many of her patrons were not so fortunate, and the artist's production virtually stopped until 1804, when François Dumont painted this miniature. During this period, Vallayer-Coster struggled to reestablish herself among the elite of Paris. Over the course of 1804, she exhibited two works at the Salon and had two works commissioned by Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Dumont's miniature depicts Vallayer-Coster holding a paintbrush in her right hand and a vase with flowers in her left, clearly an allusion to her skill as a still-life painter. Perhaps Vallayer-Coster requested that Dumont portray her as an artist in order to reassert her status as an important still-life painter. She may have intended to give the miniature to the empress in gratitude for her commissions and in the hope that there would be more to come. Her last major work, \"Still Life with Lobster\", was given to Louis XVIII and displayed at the Salon in 1817. Vallayer-Coster died in 1818 at the age of 74. Dumont worked closely with Marie Antoinette and, like Vallayer-Coster, grappled with diminished patronage after the queen's death and years of revolution. He attempted to reestablish his practice during the reigns of the Bourbon kings Louis XVIII and Charles X, but the competition provided by miniaturists like Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767-1855) proved too strong. Dumont's exquisite portrait of Vallayer-Coster was produced during a time when both artist and sitter had fallen from the limelight and were struggling to prove their enduring relevance in the new regime.

       "0    Reclining Nude depicts Picasso's lover Fernande Olivier, with whom he spent the summer of 1906 in the remote Spanish village of Gósol, where he made this sheet. Radical experimentation with technique and simplified formal distortions characterize Picasso's work at this time and can be seen here, both in Fernande's stylized face and somewhat disjointed gesture, and in the expressive strokes and spotted effects of the gouache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "10   This seated nude comes from a series of red chalk drawings that Bandinelli based loosely on Michelangelo's<em> ignudi</em> (nudes) on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–12). <em>Seated Male Nude</em> is a finished work of art: the forms have precise outlines and are filled in with painstaking hatching that renders the figure in careful relief. Bandinelli prized these drawings and encouraged his heirs to save them for posterity. One of the most important Italian sculptors of the 1500, Bandinelli created works that reflect the influence of ancient models as well as a dependence on <em>disegno</em> (drawing). Bandinelli's drawings were prized both during and after his lifetime by his many admirers and students (he opened one of the first drawing academies of Renaissance Italy).

       "21   Universally considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance, Michelangelo devoted four years to painting the vast ceiling fresco in the Sistine Chapel. This preparatory study portrays one of the 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi, who serve as supporting figures at each corner of the Old Testament scenes painted down the center of the ceiling. Michelangelo worked out the positioning of the ignudi in red chalk drawings before beginning to paint each section of wet plaster. The energy and monumentality of the figure in red chalk, whose body extends beyond the sheet, suggests the heroic athleticism of Michelangelo’s sculpture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

This figural study belongs to <em>The Female Figure</em>, a portfolio of nude studies that Struss published for artists to use.

       "29   The languorous, sensuous pose of this woman is strongly reminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres's popular paintings of odalisques, female slaves, and concubines in Turkish harems. Much of this canvas has been left thinly painted or entirely blank, suggesting that it was a figural study rather than a finished work of art. The French Academy in the 1800s viewed the depiction of the nude as the ultimate measure of an artist's skill. Because models changed poses frequently, students had to work quickly and without embellishment. Here the artist completed only those areas needed to emphasize the contours of the model's body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "409  Derived from classical antiquity, this nude male stands in the contrapposto pose, bearing his weight on his left leg, with his right leg bent, as if in motion. He steps lightly, so that only the toes of his right leg touch the ground. He stands on a laurel wreath, a plant which in antiquity would be waved as a symbol of joy after a military victory. During the Renaissance, small bronzes were kept in cabinets, bringing the gods and goddesses of ancient times into the home. Flaws in the bronze casting suggest that this piece is from the early Renaissance. In 1971, Ulrich Middeldorf rejected Olga Raggio's original attribution to an anonymous Florentine, attributing it instead to the sixteenth-century Sienese artist Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501), based partly on its resemblance to Francesco's bronze angels in Siena's Duomo. However, such details as the awkward posture and frozen motion of the body relate this work more closely to Francesco's pupil Giacomo Cozzarelli (1453-1515). Standing Figure of a Man is attributed to the circle of Francesco di Giorgio Martini, as uncertainties remain regarding its exact author.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "411  The Dance represents a stylistic fusion of classicism and scientific naturalism that dominated landscape art at the end of the 18th century. The circle of nudes dancing to a satyr’s music, ancient ruins, and sacrificial alter evoke a classical idyll, while the surrounding landscape, particularly the tree and foreground burdocks, are rendered with botanical precision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "413  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "414  Bacchanale\\r\\nDuring a visit to London in 1910, Malvina Hoffman attended two performances by the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova (1882-1931). The program included the \"Autumn Bacchanale\" section of The Seasons by Aleksandr Glazunov (1865-1936), which Pavlova danced with her partner, Mikhail Mordkin. A spirited and erotic work, the \"Bacchanale\" was inspired by the legendary followers of Bacchus (Dionysus in Greek), the ancient god of wine. The piece featured the two dancers dashing about the stage, their movements accented by veils of floating gauze. Hoffman later recalled being struck by \"impressions of motion of a new kind, of dazzling vivacity and spontaneity and yet with a control that could come only from long discipline and dedication.\" \\r\\nIn 1912 Hoffman modeled a 14-inch composition of Pavlova and Mordkin called Bacchanale Russe (Russian Bacchanale). The smiling dancers were shown nude, holding a billowing scarf above their heads, as they made their entrance on stage. It took six weeks of modeling sessions to complete the composition. Hoffman wrote to her sister: \"I have never had such a difficult problem-it's awful---I pray I may never be seized with the desire to fit two flying creatures together...again. If you could see the antics that go on, trying to get my two models to take the pose together!\"\\r\\nNine bronze casts were made of the original version during Hoffman's lifetime. In 1917 two casts were produced in a larger, nearly six-foot size. One was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where it was destroyed during the German Occupation of Paris in World War II. The other found a home in the garden of the Henry G. Dalton house on Lake Shore Boulevard in Bratenahl, Ohio. It was given to the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1943. Vibrant with life, the two figures demonstrate Hoffman's ability to capture a fleeting moment of the dance in tangible, permanent form, without sacrificing the rhythmic flow of live movement.\\r\\nThe Sculptor and the Dancer\\r\\nHoffman did not actually meet Anna Pavlova until 1914, four years after she first saw the dancer perform. The two women developed a warm friendship, with Pavlova encouraging Hoffman to attend rehearsals and make sketches from the wings during performances. \\r\\nThey also collaborated, until Pavlova's death in 1931, on a long-term endeavor---a frieze of relief panels depicting the highpoints of the entire \"Bacchanale\" in sequence. Pavlova posed for the panels with partners Laurent Novikov and Alexander Volinine, but for Hoffman that was not enough. She prepared herself for the project by learning the entire dance herself and performing it with Pavlova's assistant partner, Andreas Pavley.\\r\\nFrom New York to Paris\\r\\nThe daughter of English concert pianist Richard Hoffman, Malvina Hoffman grew up in New York City. Her artistic training began with drawing and painting, but after studying at the Art Students League and receiving helpful criticism from sculptors Herbert Adams (1858-1945) and Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), she decided to concentrate on sculpture. Traveling to Europe in 1910, she studied with Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) in Paris. To provide herself with a solid foundation in the art and craft of sculpture she took courses in dissection at the Cornell College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York and also learned the technology of casting, chasing, and patinating bronze. \\r\\nHoffman's interest in the ballet did not preclude production of works dealing with other subjects. She completed several public monuments and numerous portraits, which earned her an international reputation and led to her most ambitious project: the 1929 commission from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History for more than 100 life-size figures, heads, and busts representing the peoples of the earth.   \n",
       "415  In the early 1850s, despite protests from moralists, photographs of nudes (known as académies) were discreetly produced under the guise of \"artist's studies.\" Among those most skilled at making such studies was Julien Vallou de Villeneuve. A successful painter and lithographer during the 1820s and 1830s before turning to photography in the early 1840s, he created a new repertoire of poses for artists to use as compositional aids. Among his clients was the French realist painter Gustave Courbet (1819–1877).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "416  Whereas the ancient sculpture of Hercules nearby may have served as a sacred offering, this Renaissance plaquette and statue were collected and appreciated for the sake of art.

Ancient Greek coins likely provided the model for this particular composition, in which Hercules lifts the lion off the ground as it claws at his torso and leg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "418  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "419  Since 1994, Tunick has organized over sixty-five temporary site-related installations in public places worldwide. He deftly positions nude male and female volunteers to define and expand his chosen locations, then photographs and videotapes the installations. In early 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland organized an exhibition surveying Tunick's photographs in preparation for his June 26, 2004, installation in Cleveland. The shoot involved some 2,754 individuals-the largest installation in North America. For Ohio 4 (Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland), he posed just the men-all 1,387-kneeling in Voinovich Park, North Coast Harbor, at the end of East 9th Street. This outstanding image showcases Tunick's impressive creative and aesthetic talents to orchestrate and record a complex public installation. The undulating figures rhythmically define the vast urban\\r\\nspace while adding a haunting sense of humanity. The color photograph beautifully captures a compelling union of sculpture, performance art, and public art, with Cleveland Browns Stadium punctuating the bright, early morning sky in the background.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "420  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "421  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy.

       "422  Lachaise's highly personal sculptures of voluptuous nudes, inspired by his wife Isabel Nagel, display his idealized conception of the female figure with full, rounded breasts, arms, and thighs surrounding a delicate, slender waist. The artist's drawings, in which a single unmodulated line describes contour, are spontaneous and direct. Although this drawing was not a study for a sculpture, the figure has a three-dimensional quality suggested by the changes in the width of the line. Lachaise's drawings, like his sculptures, are dazzling combinations of force and grace, simultaneously heroic and erotic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "423  For more than forty years, Lee Friedlander has created \"social landscapes,\" images of jazz musicians, monuments, city streets, suburban backyards, and factory workers. Yet his portraits of family and friends, nudes, and still lifes demonstrate his versatility. This photograph, depicting the stems of cut flowers in a reflective glass bowl, comes from a series that Friedlander made while recovering from knee surgery. Through his keen powers of observation and conceptualization, he transformed the stems into a striking abstract composition of bold geometric forms, bathed in warm, atmospheric light. Aspects of the photographer's distinctive style-a close-up viewpoint, foreshortening, compressed space, and layering-appear in this work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "424  In Roman mythology, Neptune (or Poseidon in Greek mythology) is the god of flowing water and is believed to protect against droughts. This small bronze is likely a sculptural representation of the Wrath of Neptune from the Aeneid. During the Trojan War, Juno incited winds to sink Trojan ships. Infuriated by Juno's incursion into his domain of the sea, Neptune rides out in his chariot, saving the Trojan army and threatening to punish the winds for their insolence. The massive, muscular nude male figure stands upright on his seahorse-drawn chariot, twisting to face the wind. The turbulent waves and the windblown hair and beard of the figure give life to this small bronze. The figure's left hand would have originally held reins, while the right hand, which once held a trident, is outstretched in the act of commanding the waves to be still. This bronze was once attributed by art historian Wilhelm von Bode to Jacopo Sansovino based on its similarity to known works, such as the over-life-size marble figure of Neptune of the Scala di Giganti outside of the Doge's Palace in Venice. However, by 1921 Leo Planiscig had noted the CMA Neptune's similarity to bronzes and reliefs by Sansovino's pupil, Tiziano Minio, in the Loggetta at San Marco Square, Venice. In Minio's Jupiter on the Island of Candia for the Loggetta, the waves are represented with the same incised, undulating grooves as in this work. Neptune possesses the same stocky proportions and heavy musculature which was characteristic of Minio. The high polish and sweeping contours of the figure are characteristic of Sansovino, but the heightened drama of the subject display Minio's stylistic advancement from his teacher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "425  For his aristocratic patrons, Boucher made numerous paintings of intriguing female nudes, thinly veiled as Roman goddesses lounging in luxury. Bonnet’s color chalk-manner prints of similar subjects offered middle-class buyers sumptuous yet affordable versions of Boucher’s wildly popular images. Here, a tiny cupid pleads with Venus for his quiver of arrows as she gazes teasingly at the viewer. Their feathered ends simultaneously conceal and draw attention to her nudity. With cupid’s arrows in her control, it is Venus—rather than cupid—who has the power to arouse feelings of love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "426  Girodet found inspiration for this drawing in Aeschylus’s Greek tragedy <em>Seven against Thebes.</em> Dramatized with powerful physicality, seven warrior leaders from Argos raise weapons to the war deities Ares and Enyo at the far left as they immerse their hands in the blood of a sacrificed bull, and swear an oath to defeat Thebes. Girodet’s strong black outlines and idealized male nudes are characteristic of Neoclassicism’s calculated restraint. Yet the flash of lightning and the warrior’s impassioned expressions intensify the emotional and psychological content of the scene, anticipating the growth of romanticism in European art during the early 1800s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "427  Marco Dente was one of several printmakers who re-created Raphael’s designs as engravings. Both of Dente’s compositions after Raphael (see also the engraving above) relate to the latter’s frescos in the <em>stufetta</em>, or bathroom, of Cardinal Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena’s apartments in the Vatican Palace. A scholar of classical antiquity and a patron of the arts, the Cardinal personally chose these mildly erotic female nudes, a common subject in bathroom decorations, even for members of the clergy. Depicted here is Venus, the goddess of love and fertility. According to the myth of her birth, she was created in sea foam from the castrated genitals of the primeval sky god Uranus. In the clouds, Uranus’s son Saturn, the god of time, prepares to mutilate his father with a curved sword.

Saito found them to \"have a beauty like nudes,\" and using woodcut, he reproduced in prints the rough surface of the original clay Buddha.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, following the death of her husband, Eleanor Smith gave the museum his collection of 198 color woodcuts by Saito, nearly the complete oeuvre of this well-known, popular printmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "429  Although not exact copies, the compositions of both this bronze plaque and drawing derive from the Laocoön group, an ancient marble sculpture unearthed in 1506 in Rome. The nearly life-size statue of the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons battling giant sea snakes quickly became a source of inspiration for artists. They especially appreciated the emotional anguish and physical strain portrayed by the struggling male nudes. In The Flagellation, the sculptor Moderno adopted Laocoön’s pose and muscularity for the suffering figure of Christ, thereby presenting him as an athletic and virtuous hero. Pordenone’s drawing of a man entwined by two serpents seems to be his own expressive version of Laocoön.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "430  Dürer’s woodcut of Mary Magdalene represents a popular subject in German art and is considered a schlechtes Holzwerk, a simple woodcut intended for a general audience. According to a medieval book of saints’ lives known as the Golden Legend, Mary Magdalene spent the last 30 years of her life as a hermit outside of Marseilles, France, where she was miraculously borne aloft to heaven seven times a day to hear the choir of angels. Considered a fallen woman in her early life, Mary earned redemption through her complete devotion to Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, Dürer was preoccupied with the laws of human proportion and the female figure. Mary Magdalene’s powerful legs and widened hips are comparable to the female nudes in Dürer’s The Dream of the Doctor and Adam and Eve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "432  Conceived in 1851, after Napoleon III came to power, the railway encircling Paris was intended to transport merchandise and, eventually, passengers. The railway represented a new convenience, but measures were needed to ensure the safety of other traffic. The numerous railway crossings included in the initial plans turned out to be a source of fatal accidents. To remedy the problem, the platforms and retaining walls were to be raised at the most dangerous spots. The Cours de Vincennes, in the eastern part of Paris, had been one of the deadliest intersections. The work on an elevated railway bridge over this street, which is depicted here, was completed in February 1889. Trouillebert concentrated on portraits until about 1881, when he began to focus on landscapes. He also painted everyday scenes and nudes. He was commissioned by Edme Piot, a public works contractor, to paint this and four related views of the Paris railway construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "433  Philadelphia native Nancy Hellebrand, recognized for her portraits of the British working class, was strongly influenced by photographer Bill Brandt (1904-1983), with whom she studied from 1971 to 1973. Brandt's work included social documentation, portraiture, landscape, and nudes. While in Paris during the late 1920s, his association with artists of the Surrealist movement helped shape his sensibilities. Alluding to that movement, Hellebrand made reference to the eye-a recurrent symbol in Surrealist art-by cropping one side of the sitter's face. She emphasized Brandt's surroundings as a means of identifying his artistic and intellectual pursuits. Although positioned at the edge of the image, the sitter's placement at the forefront and Hellebrand's use of intense light and shadow produced a wonderful field of depth. Brandt's somber, isolated, and perhaps introspective appearance is reinforced by the portrait's stark black-and-white tones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "434  Since the great majority of Rembrandt's works are portraits or depictions of biblical and mythological subjects, human figures are an important element of his oeuvre. During the course of a long career Rembrandt produced nine etchings of nudes, conducting a searching analysis of the feminine form. Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background. Its beauty is further enhanced by the beige-toned Japanese paper, which adds warmth and a special glow to the flesh. Understandably, this superb impression once belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire and Chatsworth, who formed one of the finest old master print collections still in private hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "438  The woman portrayed in the oval has not yet been identified, but she is made to look highly important by her rendition in profile, like an ancient Renaissance coin, and by the elaborate decoration surrounding the cartouche (the central area containing the portrait). Increasing her distinction, the flying male nudes personify Victory and Fame, while the crown indicates her nobility. The contrast in technique between the cartouche and the portrait was purposefully emphasized to suggest that the portrait is an older \"icon\" of reverence. The finished quality of the drawing suggests that it was a presentation sheet and not a study for a work of art in another medium. Giuseppe Cades was an important history painter and frescoist, known also for his decorative ensembles. He worked mostly in Rome in a neoclassical style based on Renaissance and ancient Roman art. This drawing combines the contemporary rococo style of the red chalk portrait with the antique-based style of the surrounding decorative figures and forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

In 1971, Ulrich Middeldorf rejected Olga Raggio's original attribution to an anonymous Florentine, attributing it instead to the sixteenth-century Sienese artist Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501), based partly on its resemblance to Francesco's bronze angels in Siena's Duomo. However, such details as the awkward posture and frozen motion of the body relate this work more closely to Francesco's pupil Giacomo Cozzarelli (1453-1515).

In contrast to the other work, the faces of the Madonna and Child are significantly less expressive, and the passages of exposed skin have been left unglazed.  The Madonna holds a nude Christ on her left arm and wears a mantle of blue with green lining and a maroon tunic with a yellow collar and cuffs.  Her bright yellow shoes and the purple of her tunic are characteristic of Buglioni's color scheme and can also be seen in the other work.  The tabernacle frame is probably contemporary to the figures, although it may not have been created specifically for this altarpiece.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Andrea della Robbia, where he would have studied the family's techniques for glazing terracotta.  The frame is classically inspired, with Corinthian capitals and Buglioni's characteristic egg and dart moldings.  The facial type in this Madonna and Child recalls Buglioni's Madonna delle Grazie in Florence's Palazzo Frescobaldi, and because of this similarity, the scholar Allan Marquand attributed the Cleveland Madonna and Child to Buglioni in 1921, although this attribution has since been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009</td>\n",

Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bacchanale\\r\\nDuring a visit to London in 1910, Malvina Hoffman attended two performances by the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova (1882-1931). The program included the \"Autumn Bacchanale\" section of The Seasons by Aleksandr Glazunov (1865-1936), which Pavlova danced with her partner, Mikhail Mordkin. A spirited and erotic work, the \"Bacchanale\" was inspired by the legendary followers of Bacchus (Dionysus in Greek), the ancient god of wine. The piece featured the two dancers dashing about the stage, their movements accented by veils of floating gauze. Hoffman later recalled being struck by \"impressions of motion of a new kind, of dazzling vivacity and spontaneity and yet with a control that could come only from long discipline and dedication.\" \\r\\nIn 1912 Hoffman modeled a 14-inch composition of Pavlova and Mordkin called Bacchanale Russe (Russian Bacchanale). The smiling dancers were shown nude, holding a billowing scarf above their heads, as they made their entrance on stage. It took six weeks of modeling sessions to complete the composition. Hoffman wrote to her sister: \"I have never had such a difficult problem-it's awful---I pray I may never be seized with the desire to fit two flying creatures together...again. If you could see the antics that go on, trying to get my two models to take the pose together!\"\\r\\nNine bronze casts were made of the original version during Hoffman's lifetime. In 1917 two casts were produced in a larger, nearly six-foot size. One was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where it was destroyed during the German Occupation of Paris in World War II. The other found a home in the garden of the Henry G. Dalton house on Lake Shore Boulevard in Bratenahl, Ohio. It was given to the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1943. Vibrant with life, the two figures demonstrate Hoffman's ability to capture a fleeting moment of the dance in tangible, permanent form, without sacrificing the rhythmic flow of live movement.\\r\\nThe Sculptor and the Dancer\\r\\nHoffman did not actually meet Anna Pavlova until 1914, four years after she first saw the dancer perform. The two women developed a warm friendship, with Pavlova encouraging Hoffman to attend rehearsals and make sketches from the wings during performances. \\r\\nThey also collaborated, until Pavlova's death in 1931, on a long-term endeavor---a frieze of relief panels depicting the highpoints of the entire \"Bacchanale\" in sequence. Pavlova posed for the panels with partners Laurent Novikov and Alexander Volinine, but for Hoffman that was not enough. She prepared herself for the project by learning the entire dance herself and performing it with Pavlova's assistant partner, Andreas Pavley.\\r\\nFrom New York to Paris\\r\\nThe daughter of English concert pianist Richard Hoffman, Malvina Hoffman grew up in New York City. Her artistic training began with drawing and painting, but after studying at the Art Students League and receiving helpful criticism from sculptors Herbert Adams (1858-1945) and Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), she decided to concentrate on sculpture. Traveling to Europe in 1910, she studied with Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) in Paris. To provide herself with a solid foundation in the art and craft of sculpture she took courses in dissection at the Cornell College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York and also learned the technology of casting, chasing, and patinating bronze. \\r\\nHoffman's interest in the ballet did not preclude production of works dealing with other subjects. She completed several public monuments and numerous portraits, which earned her an international reputation and led to her most ambitious project: the 1929 commission from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History for more than 100 life-size figures, heads, and busts representing the peoples of the earth.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This plaquette by Moderno, a Northern Italian sculptor active in the early 1500s, displays the ancient subject of Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion. The subject of this plaquette finds its origins in the ancient myth of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, a popular theme during the Renaissance. After killing his wife and child in a fit of rage, Hercules was sent by an oracle to be punished by King Eurystheus of Tiryns. The King presented Hercules with twelve challenges, the first of which was to kill the Nemean lion. Twice as large as a normal lion, it had an impenetrable hide, symbolic of the uncontrollability of nature. Hercules tracked the lion to its cave, and after failing to kill it with the arrows of Apollo, Hercules strangled the lion with his bare hands. As Hercules' strength allowed him to defeat the lion, the myth expresses human dominance over nature. Hercules then used the lion's razor-sharp claws to remove its skin and returned to King Eurystheus wearing the impenetrable skin as protection. To honor the lion's struggle against Hercules, Zeus transformed the lion into the constellation Leo. In this scene, the nude Hercules stands in profile facing left with his left foot resting on the plaquette's lower border. The plaquette has no background other than a barren tree against which rest Hercules's club and Apollo's quiver and bow. The lion rests its rear paw on Hercules' thigh as Hercules lifts the lion off of the ground. The lion's body and mane consists of stylized tufts of fur which contrast with the smooth, naturalistic form of Hercules' body. The minute, short curling lines of the hair and mane create a rhythmic effect while the smooth curves of the forms place an emphasis on contour-this contrast of visual rhythm with smooth form is in fact characteristic of Moderno's bronze relief sculpture. The composition meanwhile has its origin in ancient Greek coins as well as Renaissance cameos.</td>\n",

This small bronze is likely a sculptural representation of the Wrath of Neptune from the Aeneid. During the Trojan War, Juno incited winds to sink Trojan ships. Infuriated by Juno's incursion into his domain of the sea, Neptune rides out in his chariot, saving the Trojan army and threatening to punish the winds for their insolence. The massive, muscular nude male figure stands upright on his seahorse-drawn chariot, twisting to face the wind. The turbulent waves and the windblown hair and beard of the figure give life to this small bronze. The figure's left hand would have originally held reins, while the right hand, which once held a trident, is outstretched in the act of commanding the waves to be still. This bronze was once attributed by art historian Wilhelm von Bode to Jacopo Sansovino based on its similarity to known works, such as the over-life-size marble figure of Neptune of the Scala di Giganti outside of the Doge's Palace in Venice. However, by 1921 Leo Planiscig had noted the CMA Neptune's similarity to bronzes and reliefs by Sansovino's pupil, Tiziano Minio, in the Loggetta at San Marco Square, Venice. In Minio's Jupiter on the Island of Candia for the Loggetta, the waves are represented with the same incised, undulating grooves as in this work. Neptune possesses the same stocky proportions and heavy musculature which was characteristic of Minio. The high polish and sweeping contours of the figure are characteristic of Sansovino, but the heightened drama of the subject display Minio's stylistic advancement from his teacher.</td>\n",

In 1770 Vallayer-Coster sought membership in the exclusive French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture with the submission of two still-life paintings, \"The Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture\" and \"The Attributes of Music.\" She was accepted with full rights and privileges to the overwhelmingly male academy-the only woman to be granted membership during this period independent of royal support or ties to a male academician. Denis Diderot, a French art critic and philosopher, responded to her submissions: \"It is certain that if all new members made a showing like Mademoiselle Vallayer's, and sustained the same high level of quality there, the Salon would look very different!\" Since women were officially barred during the 18th century from studying the male nude from life, still-life painting was among the few genres open to female painters. Garnering a reputation as a beautiful socialite who possessed the painting skills usually ascribed to male history painters, she was the only woman to enjoy the honor of lodging in the Louvre under the invitation of Marie Antoinette, who greatly admired her work. Marie Antoinette herself was present at the artist's 1781 marriage to Jean-Pierre-Silvestre Coster in the halls of Versailles. Despite the close associations with Antoinette and her administration, Vallayer-Coster survived the French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror in 1793. Many of her patrons were not so fortunate, and the artist's production virtually stopped until 1804, when François Dumont painted this miniature. During this period, Vallayer-Coster struggled to reestablish herself among the elite of Paris. Over the course of 1804, she exhibited two works at the Salon and had two works commissioned by Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Dumont's miniature depicts Vallayer-Coster holding a paintbrush in her right hand and a vase with flowers in her left, clearly an allusion to her skill as a still-life painter. Perhaps Vallayer-Coster requested that Dumont portray her as an artist in order to reassert her status as an important still-life painter. She may have intended to give the miniature to the empress in gratitude for her commissions and in the hope that there would be more to come. Her last major work, \"Still Life with Lobster\", was given to Louis XVIII and displayed at the Salon in 1817. Vallayer-Coster died in 1818 at the age of 74. Dumont worked closely with Marie Antoinette and, like Vallayer-Coster, grappled with diminished patronage after the queen's death and years of revolution. He attempted to reestablish his practice during the reigns of the Bourbon kings Louis XVIII and Charles X, but the competition provided by miniaturists like Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767-1855) proved too strong. Dumont's exquisite portrait of Vallayer-Coster was produced during a time when both artist and sitter had fallen from the limelight and were struggling to prove their enduring relevance in the new regime.

The railway represented a new convenience, but measures were needed to ensure the safety of other traffic. The numerous railway crossings included in the initial plans turned out to be a source of fatal accidents. To remedy the problem, the platforms and retaining walls were to be raised at the most dangerous spots. The Cours de Vincennes, in the eastern part of Paris, had been one of the deadliest intersections. The work on an elevated railway bridge over this street, which is depicted here, was completed in February 1889. Trouillebert concentrated on portraits until about 1881, when he began to focus on landscapes. He also painted everyday scenes and nudes. He was commissioned by Edme Piot, a public works contractor, to paint this and four related views of the Paris railway construction.</td>\n",

Brandt's work included social documentation, portraiture, landscape, and nudes. While in Paris during the late 1920s, his association with artists of the Surrealist movement helped shape his sensibilities. Alluding to that movement, Hellebrand made reference to the eye-a recurrent symbol in Surrealist art-by cropping one side of the sitter's face. She emphasized Brandt's surroundings as a means of identifying his artistic and intellectual pursuits. Although positioned at the edge of the image, the sitter's placement at the forefront and Hellebrand's use of intense light and shadow produced a wonderful field of depth. Brandt's somber, isolated, and perhaps introspective appearance is reinforced by the portrait's stark black-and-white tones.</td>\n",

During the course of a long career Rembrandt produced nine etchings of nudes, conducting a searching analysis of the feminine form. Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background. Its beauty is further enhanced by the beige-toned Japanese paper, which adds warmth and a special glow to the flesh. Understandably, this superb impression once belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire and Chatsworth, who formed one of the finest old master print collections still in private hands.</td>\n",

The contrast in technique between the cartouche and the portrait was purposefully emphasized to suggest that the portrait is an older \"icon\" of reverence.

Giuseppe Cades was an important history painter and frescoist, known also for his decorative ensembles. He worked mostly in Rome in a neoclassical style based on Renaissance and ancient Roman art.

       "0    This drawing depicts Picasso's lover Fernande Olivier, with whom he spent the summer of 1906 in the remote Spanish village of Gósol, where he made this sheet. Picasso was engaged in radical experimentation with technique and simplified formal distortions at this time, and this shift in his work can be seen in Fernande's stylized face and somewhat disjointed gesture, and in the expressive strokes and spotted effects of the gouache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "10   This seated nude comes from a series of red chalk drawings that Baccio Bandinelli based loosely on Michelangelo's <em>ignudi</em> (nudes) on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–12). <em>Seated Male Nude</em> is a finished work of art: the forms have precise outlines and are filled in with painstaking hatching that renders the figure in careful relief. One of the most important Italian sculptors of the 1500s, Bandinelli considered drawing his primary strength. His drawings were prized both during and after his lifetime by his many admirers and students (he opened one of the first drawing academies of Renaissance Italy).

       "410  This small devotional object differs stylistically from Buglioni's Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Anthony Abbot (1921.1180), also in the museum's collection.  In contrast to the other work, the faces of the Madonna and Child are significantly less expressive, and the passages of exposed skin have been left unglazed.  The Madonna holds a nude Christ on her left arm and wears a mantle of blue with green lining and a maroon tunic with a yellow collar and cuffs.  Her bright yellow shoes and the purple of her tunic are characteristic of Buglioni's color scheme and can also be seen in the other work.  The tabernacle frame is probably contemporary to the figures, although it may not have been created specifically for this altarpiece.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Andrea della Robbia, where he would have studied the family's techniques for glazing terracotta.  The frame is classically inspired, with Corinthian capitals and Buglioni's characteristic egg and dart moldings.  The facial type in this Madonna and Child recalls Buglioni's Madonna delle Grazie in Florence's Palazzo Frescobaldi, and because of this similarity, the scholar Allan Marquand attributed the Cleveland Madonna and Child to Buglioni in 1921, although this attribution has since been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "412  These gilt bronze putti, or figures of plump male children in the nude, are near mirror images of one another.  Both are seated, with their arms flung to the side.  Minimal detailing exists in the hands and feet, with the fingers and toes signified only by simple line indentations.  The function and original placement of the putti is uncertain, but their posture and the placement of their hands suggest that originally they may have been placed in a larger statue group, perhaps holding either side of a banner, or even a piece of furniture.  A will drawn up by Guglielmo della Porta in 1558 mentions the existence of bronze Passion scenes and crucifixes, suggesting that the artist may have created other small bronze groups as well.  John Pope-Hennessey attributed these works to della Porta based on their similarity to the figures of Apollo and Artemis in Latona and her Children (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) and the monumental putti in his Tomb of Cardinal Paolo Cesi in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, although more recent research points away from della Porta as the maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "416  This plaquette by Moderno, a Northern Italian sculptor active in the early 1500s, displays the ancient subject of Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion. The subject of this plaquette finds its origins in the ancient myth of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, a popular theme during the Renaissance. After killing his wife and child in a fit of rage, Hercules was sent by an oracle to be punished by King Eurystheus of Tiryns. The King presented Hercules with twelve challenges, the first of which was to kill the Nemean lion. Twice as large as a normal lion, it had an impenetrable hide, symbolic of the uncontrollability of nature. Hercules tracked the lion to its cave, and after failing to kill it with the arrows of Apollo, Hercules strangled the lion with his bare hands. As Hercules' strength allowed him to defeat the lion, the myth expresses human dominance over nature. Hercules then used the lion's razor-sharp claws to remove its skin and returned to King Eurystheus wearing the impenetrable skin as protection. To honor the lion's struggle against Hercules, Zeus transformed the lion into the constellation Leo. In this scene, the nude Hercules stands in profile facing left with his left foot resting on the plaquette's lower border. The plaquette has no background other than a barren tree against which rest Hercules's club and Apollo's quiver and bow. The lion rests its rear paw on Hercules' thigh as Hercules lifts the lion off of the ground. The lion's body and mane consists of stylized tufts of fur which contrast with the smooth, naturalistic form of Hercules' body. The minute, short curling lines of the hair and mane create a rhythmic effect while the smooth curves of the forms place an emphasis on contour-this contrast of visual rhythm with smooth form is in fact characteristic of Moderno's bronze relief sculpture. The composition meanwhile has its origin in ancient Greek coins as well as Renaissance cameos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "417  These gilt bronze putti, or figures of plump male children in the nude, are near mirror images of one another.  Both are seated, with their arms flung to the side.  Minimal detailing exists in the hands and feet, with the fingers and toes signified only by simple line indentations.  The function and original placement of the putti is uncertain, but their posture and the placement of their hands suggest that originally they may have been placed in a larger statue group, perhaps holding either side of a banner, or even a piece of furniture.  A will drawn up by Guglielmo della Porta in 1558 mentions the existence of bronze Passion scenes and crucifixes, suggesting that the artist may have created other small bronze groups as well.  John Pope-Hennessey attributed these works to della Porta based on their similarity to the figures of Apollo and Artemis in Latona and her Children (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) and the monumental putti in his Tomb of Cardinal Paolo Cesi in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, although more recent research points away from della Porta as the maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "431  Born in 1744, Anne Vallayer-Coster was a prominent still-life painter in France during the 1770s and 1780s. The daughter of a goldsmith, she grew up observing the intricacies of metalwork, acquiring an attention to detail apparent in her paintings. She was apprenticed to the seascape painter Joseph Vernet who encouraged her to pursue painting as a profession. In 1770 Vallayer-Coster sought membership in the exclusive French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture with the submission of two still-life paintings, \"The Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture\" and \"The Attributes of Music.\" She was accepted with full rights and privileges to the overwhelmingly male academy-the only woman to be granted membership during this period independent of royal support or ties to a male academician. Denis Diderot, a French art critic and philosopher, responded to her submissions: \"It is certain that if all new members made a showing like Mademoiselle Vallayer's, and sustained the same high level of quality there, the Salon would look very different!\" Since women were officially barred during the 18th century from studying the male nude from life, still-life painting was among the few genres open to female painters. Garnering a reputation as a beautiful socialite who possessed the painting skills usually ascribed to male history painters, she was the only woman to enjoy the honor of lodging in the Louvre under the invitation of Marie Antoinette, who greatly admired her work. Marie Antoinette herself was present at the artist's 1781 marriage to Jean-Pierre-Silvestre Coster in the halls of Versailles. Despite the close associations with Antoinette and her administration, Vallayer-Coster survived the French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror in 1793. Many of her patrons were not so fortunate, and the artist's production virtually stopped until 1804, when François Dumont painted this miniature. During this period, Vallayer-Coster struggled to reestablish herself among the elite of Paris. Over the course of 1804, she exhibited two works at the Salon and had two works commissioned by Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Dumont's miniature depicts Vallayer-Coster holding a paintbrush in her right hand and a vase with flowers in her left, clearly an allusion to her skill as a still-life painter. Perhaps Vallayer-Coster requested that Dumont portray her as an artist in order to reassert her status as an important still-life painter. She may have intended to give the miniature to the empress in gratitude for her commissions and in the hope that there would be more to come. Her last major work, \"Still Life with Lobster\", was given to Louis XVIII and displayed at the Salon in 1817. Vallayer-Coster died in 1818 at the age of 74. Dumont worked closely with Marie Antoinette and, like Vallayer-Coster, grappled with diminished patronage after the queen's death and years of revolution. He attempted to reestablish his practice during the reigns of the Bourbon kings Louis XVIII and Charles X, but the competition provided by miniaturists like Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767-1855) proved too strong. Dumont's exquisite portrait of Vallayer-Coster was produced during a time when both artist and sitter had fallen from the limelight and were struggling to prove their enduring relevance in the new regime.

       "0    Reclining Nude depicts Picasso's lover Fernande Olivier, with whom he spent the summer of 1906 in the remote Spanish village of Gósol, where he made this sheet. Radical experimentation with technique and simplified formal distortions characterize Picasso's work at this time and can be seen here, both in Fernande's stylized face and somewhat disjointed gesture, and in the expressive strokes and spotted effects of the gouache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "10   This seated nude comes from a series of red chalk drawings that Bandinelli based loosely on Michelangelo's<em> ignudi</em> (nudes) on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–12). <em>Seated Male Nude</em> is a finished work of art: the forms have precise outlines and are filled in with painstaking hatching that renders the figure in careful relief. Bandinelli prized these drawings and encouraged his heirs to save them for posterity. One of the most important Italian sculptors of the 1500, Bandinelli created works that reflect the influence of ancient models as well as a dependence on <em>disegno</em> (drawing). Bandinelli's drawings were prized both during and after his lifetime by his many admirers and students (he opened one of the first drawing academies of Renaissance Italy).

       "21   Universally considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance, Michelangelo devoted four years to painting the vast ceiling fresco in the Sistine Chapel. This preparatory study portrays one of the 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi, who serve as supporting figures at each corner of the Old Testament scenes painted down the center of the ceiling. Michelangelo worked out the positioning of the ignudi in red chalk drawings before beginning to paint each section of wet plaster. The energy and monumentality of the figure in red chalk, whose body extends beyond the sheet, suggests the heroic athleticism of Michelangelo’s sculpture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

This figural study belongs to <em>The Female Figure</em>, a portfolio of nude studies that Struss published for artists to use.

       "29   The languorous, sensuous pose of this woman is strongly reminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres's popular paintings of odalisques, female slaves, and concubines in Turkish harems. Much of this canvas has been left thinly painted or entirely blank, suggesting that it was a figural study rather than a finished work of art. The French Academy in the 1800s viewed the depiction of the nude as the ultimate measure of an artist's skill. Because models changed poses frequently, students had to work quickly and without embellishment. Here the artist completed only those areas needed to emphasize the contours of the model's body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "409  Derived from classical antiquity, this nude male stands in the contrapposto pose, bearing his weight on his left leg, with his right leg bent, as if in motion. He steps lightly, so that only the toes of his right leg touch the ground. He stands on a laurel wreath, a plant which in antiquity would be waved as a symbol of joy after a military victory. During the Renaissance, small bronzes were kept in cabinets, bringing the gods and goddesses of ancient times into the home. Flaws in the bronze casting suggest that this piece is from the early Renaissance. In 1971, Ulrich Middeldorf rejected Olga Raggio's original attribution to an anonymous Florentine, attributing it instead to the sixteenth-century Sienese artist Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501), based partly on its resemblance to Francesco's bronze angels in Siena's Duomo. However, such details as the awkward posture and frozen motion of the body relate this work more closely to Francesco's pupil Giacomo Cozzarelli (1453-1515). Standing Figure of a Man is attributed to the circle of Francesco di Giorgio Martini, as uncertainties remain regarding its exact author.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "411  The Dance represents a stylistic fusion of classicism and scientific naturalism that dominated landscape art at the end of the 18th century. The circle of nudes dancing to a satyr’s music, ancient ruins, and sacrificial alter evoke a classical idyll, while the surrounding landscape, particularly the tree and foreground burdocks, are rendered with botanical precision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "413  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "414  Bacchanale\\r\\nDuring a visit to London in 1910, Malvina Hoffman attended two performances by the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova (1882-1931). The program included the \"Autumn Bacchanale\" section of The Seasons by Aleksandr Glazunov (1865-1936), which Pavlova danced with her partner, Mikhail Mordkin. A spirited and erotic work, the \"Bacchanale\" was inspired by the legendary followers of Bacchus (Dionysus in Greek), the ancient god of wine. The piece featured the two dancers dashing about the stage, their movements accented by veils of floating gauze. Hoffman later recalled being struck by \"impressions of motion of a new kind, of dazzling vivacity and spontaneity and yet with a control that could come only from long discipline and dedication.\" \\r\\nIn 1912 Hoffman modeled a 14-inch composition of Pavlova and Mordkin called Bacchanale Russe (Russian Bacchanale). The smiling dancers were shown nude, holding a billowing scarf above their heads, as they made their entrance on stage. It took six weeks of modeling sessions to complete the composition. Hoffman wrote to her sister: \"I have never had such a difficult problem-it's awful---I pray I may never be seized with the desire to fit two flying creatures together...again. If you could see the antics that go on, trying to get my two models to take the pose together!\"\\r\\nNine bronze casts were made of the original version during Hoffman's lifetime. In 1917 two casts were produced in a larger, nearly six-foot size. One was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where it was destroyed during the German Occupation of Paris in World War II. The other found a home in the garden of the Henry G. Dalton house on Lake Shore Boulevard in Bratenahl, Ohio. It was given to the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1943. Vibrant with life, the two figures demonstrate Hoffman's ability to capture a fleeting moment of the dance in tangible, permanent form, without sacrificing the rhythmic flow of live movement.\\r\\nThe Sculptor and the Dancer\\r\\nHoffman did not actually meet Anna Pavlova until 1914, four years after she first saw the dancer perform. The two women developed a warm friendship, with Pavlova encouraging Hoffman to attend rehearsals and make sketches from the wings during performances. \\r\\nThey also collaborated, until Pavlova's death in 1931, on a long-term endeavor---a frieze of relief panels depicting the highpoints of the entire \"Bacchanale\" in sequence. Pavlova posed for the panels with partners Laurent Novikov and Alexander Volinine, but for Hoffman that was not enough. She prepared herself for the project by learning the entire dance herself and performing it with Pavlova's assistant partner, Andreas Pavley.\\r\\nFrom New York to Paris\\r\\nThe daughter of English concert pianist Richard Hoffman, Malvina Hoffman grew up in New York City. Her artistic training began with drawing and painting, but after studying at the Art Students League and receiving helpful criticism from sculptors Herbert Adams (1858-1945) and Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), she decided to concentrate on sculpture. Traveling to Europe in 1910, she studied with Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) in Paris. To provide herself with a solid foundation in the art and craft of sculpture she took courses in dissection at the Cornell College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York and also learned the technology of casting, chasing, and patinating bronze. \\r\\nHoffman's interest in the ballet did not preclude production of works dealing with other subjects. She completed several public monuments and numerous portraits, which earned her an international reputation and led to her most ambitious project: the 1929 commission from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History for more than 100 life-size figures, heads, and busts representing the peoples of the earth.   \n",
       "415  In the early 1850s, despite protests from moralists, photographs of nudes (known as académies) were discreetly produced under the guise of \"artist's studies.\" Among those most skilled at making such studies was Julien Vallou de Villeneuve. A successful painter and lithographer during the 1820s and 1830s before turning to photography in the early 1840s, he created a new repertoire of poses for artists to use as compositional aids. Among his clients was the French realist painter Gustave Courbet (1819–1877).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "416  Whereas the ancient sculpture of Hercules nearby may have served as a sacred offering, this Renaissance plaquette and statue were collected and appreciated for the sake of art.

Ancient Greek coins likely provided the model for this particular composition, in which Hercules lifts the lion off the ground as it claws at his torso and leg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "418  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "419  Since 1994, Tunick has organized over sixty-five temporary site-related installations in public places worldwide. He deftly positions nude male and female volunteers to define and expand his chosen locations, then photographs and videotapes the installations. In early 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland organized an exhibition surveying Tunick's photographs in preparation for his June 26, 2004, installation in Cleveland. The shoot involved some 2,754 individuals-the largest installation in North America. For Ohio 4 (Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland), he posed just the men-all 1,387-kneeling in Voinovich Park, North Coast Harbor, at the end of East 9th Street. This outstanding image showcases Tunick's impressive creative and aesthetic talents to orchestrate and record a complex public installation. The undulating figures rhythmically define the vast urban\\r\\nspace while adding a haunting sense of humanity. The color photograph beautifully captures a compelling union of sculpture, performance art, and public art, with Cleveland Browns Stadium punctuating the bright, early morning sky in the background.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "420  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "421  Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy.

       "422  Lachaise's highly personal sculptures of voluptuous nudes, inspired by his wife Isabel Nagel, display his idealized conception of the female figure with full, rounded breasts, arms, and thighs surrounding a delicate, slender waist. The artist's drawings, in which a single unmodulated line describes contour, are spontaneous and direct. Although this drawing was not a study for a sculpture, the figure has a three-dimensional quality suggested by the changes in the width of the line. Lachaise's drawings, like his sculptures, are dazzling combinations of force and grace, simultaneously heroic and erotic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "423  For more than forty years, Lee Friedlander has created \"social landscapes,\" images of jazz musicians, monuments, city streets, suburban backyards, and factory workers. Yet his portraits of family and friends, nudes, and still lifes demonstrate his versatility. This photograph, depicting the stems of cut flowers in a reflective glass bowl, comes from a series that Friedlander made while recovering from knee surgery. Through his keen powers of observation and conceptualization, he transformed the stems into a striking abstract composition of bold geometric forms, bathed in warm, atmospheric light. Aspects of the photographer's distinctive style-a close-up viewpoint, foreshortening, compressed space, and layering-appear in this work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "424  In Roman mythology, Neptune (or Poseidon in Greek mythology) is the god of flowing water and is believed to protect against droughts. This small bronze is likely a sculptural representation of the Wrath of Neptune from the Aeneid. During the Trojan War, Juno incited winds to sink Trojan ships. Infuriated by Juno's incursion into his domain of the sea, Neptune rides out in his chariot, saving the Trojan army and threatening to punish the winds for their insolence. The massive, muscular nude male figure stands upright on his seahorse-drawn chariot, twisting to face the wind. The turbulent waves and the windblown hair and beard of the figure give life to this small bronze. The figure's left hand would have originally held reins, while the right hand, which once held a trident, is outstretched in the act of commanding the waves to be still. This bronze was once attributed by art historian Wilhelm von Bode to Jacopo Sansovino based on its similarity to known works, such as the over-life-size marble figure of Neptune of the Scala di Giganti outside of the Doge's Palace in Venice. However, by 1921 Leo Planiscig had noted the CMA Neptune's similarity to bronzes and reliefs by Sansovino's pupil, Tiziano Minio, in the Loggetta at San Marco Square, Venice. In Minio's Jupiter on the Island of Candia for the Loggetta, the waves are represented with the same incised, undulating grooves as in this work. Neptune possesses the same stocky proportions and heavy musculature which was characteristic of Minio. The high polish and sweeping contours of the figure are characteristic of Sansovino, but the heightened drama of the subject display Minio's stylistic advancement from his teacher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "425  For his aristocratic patrons, Boucher made numerous paintings of intriguing female nudes, thinly veiled as Roman goddesses lounging in luxury. Bonnet’s color chalk-manner prints of similar subjects offered middle-class buyers sumptuous yet affordable versions of Boucher’s wildly popular images. Here, a tiny cupid pleads with Venus for his quiver of arrows as she gazes teasingly at the viewer. Their feathered ends simultaneously conceal and draw attention to her nudity. With cupid’s arrows in her control, it is Venus—rather than cupid—who has the power to arouse feelings of love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "426  Girodet found inspiration for this drawing in Aeschylus’s Greek tragedy <em>Seven against Thebes.</em> Dramatized with powerful physicality, seven warrior leaders from Argos raise weapons to the war deities Ares and Enyo at the far left as they immerse their hands in the blood of a sacrificed bull, and swear an oath to defeat Thebes. Girodet’s strong black outlines and idealized male nudes are characteristic of Neoclassicism’s calculated restraint. Yet the flash of lightning and the warrior’s impassioned expressions intensify the emotional and psychological content of the scene, anticipating the growth of romanticism in European art during the early 1800s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "427  Marco Dente was one of several printmakers who re-created Raphael’s designs as engravings. Both of Dente’s compositions after Raphael (see also the engraving above) relate to the latter’s frescos in the <em>stufetta</em>, or bathroom, of Cardinal Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena’s apartments in the Vatican Palace. A scholar of classical antiquity and a patron of the arts, the Cardinal personally chose these mildly erotic female nudes, a common subject in bathroom decorations, even for members of the clergy. Depicted here is Venus, the goddess of love and fertility. According to the myth of her birth, she was created in sea foam from the castrated genitals of the primeval sky god Uranus. In the clouds, Uranus’s son Saturn, the god of time, prepares to mutilate his father with a curved sword.

Saito found them to \"have a beauty like nudes,\" and using woodcut, he reproduced in prints the rough surface of the original clay Buddha.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, following the death of her husband, Eleanor Smith gave the museum his collection of 198 color woodcuts by Saito, nearly the complete oeuvre of this well-known, popular printmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "429  Although not exact copies, the compositions of both this bronze plaque and drawing derive from the Laocoön group, an ancient marble sculpture unearthed in 1506 in Rome. The nearly life-size statue of the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons battling giant sea snakes quickly became a source of inspiration for artists. They especially appreciated the emotional anguish and physical strain portrayed by the struggling male nudes. In The Flagellation, the sculptor Moderno adopted Laocoön’s pose and muscularity for the suffering figure of Christ, thereby presenting him as an athletic and virtuous hero. Pordenone’s drawing of a man entwined by two serpents seems to be his own expressive version of Laocoön.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "430  Dürer’s woodcut of Mary Magdalene represents a popular subject in German art and is considered a schlechtes Holzwerk, a simple woodcut intended for a general audience. According to a medieval book of saints’ lives known as the Golden Legend, Mary Magdalene spent the last 30 years of her life as a hermit outside of Marseilles, France, where she was miraculously borne aloft to heaven seven times a day to hear the choir of angels. Considered a fallen woman in her early life, Mary earned redemption through her complete devotion to Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, Dürer was preoccupied with the laws of human proportion and the female figure. Mary Magdalene’s powerful legs and widened hips are comparable to the female nudes in Dürer’s The Dream of the Doctor and Adam and Eve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "432  Conceived in 1851, after Napoleon III came to power, the railway encircling Paris was intended to transport merchandise and, eventually, passengers. The railway represented a new convenience, but measures were needed to ensure the safety of other traffic. The numerous railway crossings included in the initial plans turned out to be a source of fatal accidents. To remedy the problem, the platforms and retaining walls were to be raised at the most dangerous spots. The Cours de Vincennes, in the eastern part of Paris, had been one of the deadliest intersections. The work on an elevated railway bridge over this street, which is depicted here, was completed in February 1889. Trouillebert concentrated on portraits until about 1881, when he began to focus on landscapes. He also painted everyday scenes and nudes. He was commissioned by Edme Piot, a public works contractor, to paint this and four related views of the Paris railway construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "433  Philadelphia native Nancy Hellebrand, recognized for her portraits of the British working class, was strongly influenced by photographer Bill Brandt (1904-1983), with whom she studied from 1971 to 1973. Brandt's work included social documentation, portraiture, landscape, and nudes. While in Paris during the late 1920s, his association with artists of the Surrealist movement helped shape his sensibilities. Alluding to that movement, Hellebrand made reference to the eye-a recurrent symbol in Surrealist art-by cropping one side of the sitter's face. She emphasized Brandt's surroundings as a means of identifying his artistic and intellectual pursuits. Although positioned at the edge of the image, the sitter's placement at the forefront and Hellebrand's use of intense light and shadow produced a wonderful field of depth. Brandt's somber, isolated, and perhaps introspective appearance is reinforced by the portrait's stark black-and-white tones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "434  Since the great majority of Rembrandt's works are portraits or depictions of biblical and mythological subjects, human figures are an important element of his oeuvre. During the course of a long career Rembrandt produced nine etchings of nudes, conducting a searching analysis of the feminine form. Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background. Its beauty is further enhanced by the beige-toned Japanese paper, which adds warmth and a special glow to the flesh. Understandably, this superb impression once belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire and Chatsworth, who formed one of the finest old master print collections still in private hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "438  The woman portrayed in the oval has not yet been identified, but she is made to look highly important by her rendition in profile, like an ancient Renaissance coin, and by the elaborate decoration surrounding the cartouche (the central area containing the portrait). Increasing her distinction, the flying male nudes personify Victory and Fame, while the crown indicates her nobility. The contrast in technique between the cartouche and the portrait was purposefully emphasized to suggest that the portrait is an older \"icon\" of reverence. The finished quality of the drawing suggests that it was a presentation sheet and not a study for a work of art in another medium. Giuseppe Cades was an important history painter and frescoist, known also for his decorative ensembles. He worked mostly in Rome in a neoclassical style based on Renaissance and ancient Roman art. This drawing combines the contemporary rococo style of the red chalk portrait with the antique-based style of the surrounding decorative figures and forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

He also unevenly laid the etching ground on the plate, resulting in the irregular tone in the background.

Derived from the inventions of Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802-1875) in 1832 and Sir David Brewster (1781-1868) in 1849, the stereoscopic technique produced two almost identical photographic images. When seen simultaneously in a viewing instrument called a stereoscope, the resulting effect was an astonishing illusion of three-dimensional space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rare example comes from an important group of nude studies Gouin created in the early 1850s. To create the image, Gouin carefully posed a favorite model--Delphine Herbé, a florist--in his third-floor studio where the bright, natural light would define her body. Drapery was used to relieve the monotony of the background and heighten the three-dimensionality of the model's form and echo its contours. Gouin's training as a painter of miniatures is evident in the delicacy of the hand-coloring and in the subtle, naturalistic application of pigment over the polished surface of the plate.\\r\\n</td>\n",

In this example, he carefully positioned his model with favorite props, such as a chaise longue and copious amounts of rich drapery. Natural illumination in the skylit studio clearly defines her sensuous body with bright highlights and rich shadows. The luxurious flesh tones and the suggestive pose add to the picture's eroticism.

Kirchner owned one large lithographic stone, from which he made one lithograph after another simply by sanding down the stone, and then starting again with a new composition. This resulted in very small editions. By spreading water mixed with turpentine over the surface of the stone to loosen the lithographic crayon, he created unexpected and spontaneous results, seen here in the grainy and broken lines.</td>\n",

The print may have functioned as a model for workshop apprentices studying human anatomy while learning to draw; however, the artist’s Latin signature suggests it also had an audience educated in literature. Art historians remain uncertain whether Pollaiuolo intended to depict a particular story or historical event. It is possible he created a deliberately ambiguous allegory that would appeal to patrons interested in interpreting symbols. For example, the continuous chain shared by the two central men could refer to an ancient idea that the body is the chain of the soul, only to be released in death.</td>\n",

This preparatory study portrays one of the 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi, who serve as supporting figures at each corner of the Old Testament scenes painted down the center of the ceiling. Michelangelo worked out the positioning of the ignudi in red chalk drawings before beginning to paint each section of wet plaster. The energy and monumentality of the figure in red chalk, whose body extends beyond the sheet, suggests the heroic athleticism of Michelangelo’s sculpture.</td>\n",

While the traditional subject of a female nude in front of a mirror suggests an allegory of beauty or vanity, Schmidt-Rottluff’s nude avoids idealization. The model’s mask-like features and body decoration also reference tribal art, which Brücke artists admired at the Dresden ethnological museum, particularly the wooden relief carvings from Palau, Micronesia, that show similar forms and markings.</td>\n",

In the early 1880s, he began photographic experiments that would allow him to create a more accurate and convincing rendering of anatomy and the human form in motion. Recognizing the assistance these visual reminders could provide the artist, Eakins and his circle began photographing a series of nude forms modeled by men, women, and children. These images, which he called the Naked Series, consist of seven contact-printed photographs mounted on cardboard strips. They show the models from the front, side, and rear posed in contrapposto positions or with their weight equally distributed. Eakins’s other photographic endeavors included a series on the figure in motion—photographs that were clearly used as studies for paintings—and more traditional portraits and figural groupings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Milton Avery was a quiet, humble man whose art reflected his life. Inspired by personal experience and based on direct observation, his relaxed, intimate works depict a serene, ideal world. Landscapes evoke summer trips to the country and seaside; urban scenes depict family and friends. From apparently ordinary subject matter, Avery constructed innovative works in which simplified flat forms build perfectly balanced, satisfying compositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Chris Ritter, director of the Laurel Gallery, New York, published four issues of Laurels, portfolios of prints, literature, and original calligraphy often on paper handmade by Douglass Howell. The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Both Outerbridge and the French painters he admired presented the female nude with a balance of classical, naive innocence and worldly sensuality. In this image, Outerbridge depicted a partially nude young woman, whose averted face is thrown into shadow by her lace cap.

Raphael used metalpoint, a technique popular in 15th- and early 16th-century Italy on a pink prepared surface. The pose of the infant's head in the drawing was based on that of the Christ child in Leonardo da Vinci's <em>Benois Madonna</em>, then in a private collection in Florence, with changes—such as the uplifted eyes and open mouth—made by Raphael. The curving back of the female nude is echoed in the roundness of the child's head.

Raphael used metalpoint, a technique popular in 15th- and early 16th-century Italy. As the name implies, metalpoint employed a stylus of soft metal—usually silver or a silver alloy—that left a mark when applied to a specially prepared sheet coated with ground eggshell, powdered bone, or lead white. The rough texture allowed for a deposit of the metal to be left on the surface. The preparation of the ground was often tinted with pigment (here Raphael used pink) so that the delicate gray lines of the metalpoint would stand out. The rigorous technique cannot be erased or effaced, thus demonstrating the artist’s superlative draftsmanship.</td>\n",

She often used mythological themes rendered in soft focus, and manipulated her prints and negatives to remove her photographic subject matter from common, everyday reality. This print exemplifies Brigman's allegorical photography, in which nude figures were integrated into natural settings. In Greek mythology a Hamadryad is a nymph whose life begins and ends with that of a specific tree. Here, two nude females, representing \"wood nymphs,\" were carefully placed among the flowing forms of an isolated tree in the Sierra Nevada mountains, a favorite location for much of Brigman's work.</td>\n",

For a woman artist to address the subject transgressed social norms of the period. Women were not permitted to attend the illustrious École des Beaux-Arts until 1897, and even at the Académie Julian, which opened to women in 1868, they were not permitted to draw from nude models. Cassatt's answer to the rules of decorum was to suggest the setting of a bourgeois house, rather than the settings her male contemporaries preferred—such as the Turkish bath or the brothel. In her description of the female body, Cassatt relied upon the stylized elegance of her Japanese prototypes, thereby abstracting the nudity of her model.</td>\n",

She holds a bowl of fruit in her left hand while her right hand is clenched, suggesting it may have once held another object.

The series featured almost 200 studies of nude female figures reflected in a parabolic mirror that came from an amusement park. The inspiration for the series was a commission by the humorous and risqué French magazine Le Sourire. Using the mirror to contract, twist, and taper the nude figures, Kertész produced fantastic, ephemeral results ranging from amusing to grotesque and frightening. In this image-one of his best-Kertész created a composition that is appealing yet tantalizingly undecipherable. The model's body, simultaneously foreshortened and elongated, concrete and abstract, sweeps around mysterious reflected shapes and textures present in the studio. The Distortions have obvious affinities with the radical changes occurring in the visualization of the human figure in painting and sculpture of the 1930s.

The complete sculpture most likely showed the young god pulling back a slender laurel tree with his raised left hand, while holding an arrow at waist level with his right, poised to strike the lizard creeping up the tree. Two Roman marble copies preserve the complete composition: one in the Louvre, the other in the Vatican. The museum's sculpture is the only known life-size bronze version of the Apollo Sauroktonos. Technical features such as the way the sculpture was cast and repaired in antiquity, the copper inlays of the lips and nipples, and the stone insert for the right eye (the left is a restoration) are consistent with a date in the 4th century bc. However, technically it may have been possible to produce such a work in the Hellenistic period. The Apollo Sauroktonos is thought to have been created by Praxiteles about 350 bc. Androgynous sensuality and languid, gracefully curved poses are hallmarks of his style. The finest large classical Greek statues were bronzes, but few have survived. If this sculpture is a product of Praxiteles' workshop, it is the only large Greek bronze statue that can be attributed to a Greek sculptor. Praxiteles was widely popular in his day. His famous Aphrodite of Cnidus (late 360s bc) introduced the life-size nude female figure to Western art.</td>\n",

The complete sculpture most likely showed the young god pulling back a slender laurel tree with his raised left hand, while holding an arrow at waist level with his right, poised to strike the lizard creeping up the tree. Two Roman marble copies preserve the complete composition: one in the Louvre, the other in the Vatican. The museum's sculpture is the only known life-size bronze version of the Apollo Sauroktonos. Technical features such as the way the sculpture was cast and repaired in antiquity, the copper inlays of the lips and nipples, and the stone insert for the right eye (the left is a restoration) are consistent with a date in the 4th century bc. However, technically it may have been possible to produce such a work in the Hellenistic period. The Apollo Sauroktonos is thought to have been created by Praxiteles about 350 bc. Androgynous sensuality and languid, gracefully curved poses are hallmarks of his style. The finest large classical Greek statues were bronzes, but few have survived. If this sculpture is a product of Praxiteles' workshop, it is the only large Greek bronze statue that can be attributed to a Greek sculptor. Praxiteles was widely popular in his day. His famous Aphrodite of Cnidus (late 360s bc) introduced the life-size nude female figure to Western art.</td>\n",

Here, the mother leans over the child in an enclosed, protective gesture, perhaps whispering a lullaby. Whistler's treatment of the figure's robe, a semi-classical design based on Roman dress, captured the translucent qualities of the drapery which partly reveals and partly conceals the form beneath. Of this group, the artist's favorite etching was Cameo No. 1, and in 1893 he chose it to be exhibited among a selection of his prints at the Chicago World's Fair. American collectors, however, found Cameo No. 1 too risqué, and the artist was told it was unsalable because of \"the thinness of the drapery.\"</td>\n",

His reputation as the century's most controversial artist began with the public's riotous reaction to his Nude Desending a Staircase at the 1913 Armory Show. That same year he created his first \"ready-made\" by attaching a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool. In 1917, he exhibited a urinal under the title Fountain, and in 1919, he created his infamous L.H.O.O.Q. by adding a goatee over a printed reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Often adding inscriptions with humorous puns and ironic double meanings to his works, Duchamp raised philosophical speculation to a higher level of importance than the physical object.

The Madonna holds a nude Christ on her left arm and wears a mantle of blue with green lining and a maroon tunic with a yellow collar and cuffs.  Her bright yellow shoes and the purple of her tunic are characteristic of Buglioni's color scheme and can also be seen in the other work.  The tabernacle frame is probably contemporary to the figures, although it may not have been created specifically for this altarpiece.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Andrea della Robbia, where he would have studied the family's techniques for glazing terracotta.  The frame is classically inspired, with Corinthian capitals and Buglioni's characteristic egg and dart moldings.  The facial type in this Madonna and Child recalls Buglioni's Madonna delle Grazie in Florence's Palazzo Frescobaldi, and because of this similarity, the scholar Allan Marquand attributed the Cleveland Madonna and Child to Buglioni in 1921, although this attribution has since been questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna Dieglio 2009</td>\n",

The museum's collection already includes the first two issues, with prints by Joan Miró, Stanley William Hayter, Reginald Marsh, and others. The five drypoints shown here were made for the fourth Laurels Portfolio. They encompass Avery's favorite motifs: landscape, seascape, and figure, all delineated with amazing economy. For example, the Nude with Long Torso is drawn with two horizontal lines that span the length of the plate. By subtly controlling the thickness of line or placement of a shape, a sense of roundness, weight, and a shallow space are created.\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bacchanale\\r\\nDuring a visit to London in 1910, Malvina Hoffman attended two performances by the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova (1882-1931). The program included the \"Autumn Bacchanale\" section of The Seasons by Aleksandr Glazunov (1865-1936), which Pavlova danced with her partner, Mikhail Mordkin. A spirited and erotic work, the \"Bacchanale\" was inspired by the legendary followers of Bacchus (Dionysus in Greek), the ancient god of wine. The piece featured the two dancers dashing about the stage, their movements accented by veils of floating gauze. Hoffman later recalled being struck by \"impressions of motion of a new kind, of dazzling vivacity and spontaneity and yet with a control that could come only from long discipline and dedication.\" \\r\\nIn 1912 Hoffman modeled a 14-inch composition of Pavlova and Mordkin called Bacchanale Russe (Russian Bacchanale). The smiling dancers were shown nude, holding a billowing scarf above their heads, as they made their entrance on stage. It took six weeks of modeling sessions to complete the composition. Hoffman wrote to her sister: \"I have never had such a difficult problem-it's awful---I pray I may never be seized with the desire to fit two flying creatures together...again. If you could see the antics that go on, trying to get my two models to take the pose together!\"\\r\\nNine bronze casts were made of the original version during Hoffman's lifetime. In 1917 two casts were produced in a larger, nearly six-foot size. One was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where it was destroyed during the German Occupation of Paris in World War II. The other found a home in the garden of the Henry G. Dalton house on Lake Shore Boulevard in Bratenahl, Ohio. It was given to the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1943. Vibrant with life, the two figures demonstrate Hoffman's ability to capture a fleeting moment of the dance in tangible, permanent form, without sacrificing the rhythmic flow of live movement.\\r\\nThe Sculptor and the Dancer\\r\\nHoffman did not actually meet Anna Pavlova until 1914, four years after she first saw the dancer perform. The two women developed a warm friendship, with Pavlova encouraging Hoffman to attend rehearsals and make sketches from the wings during performances. \\r\\nThey also collaborated, until Pavlova's death in 1931, on a long-term endeavor---a frieze of relief panels depicting the highpoints of the entire \"Bacchanale\" in sequence. Pavlova posed for the panels with partners Laurent Novikov and Alexander Volinine, but for Hoffman that was not enough. She prepared herself for the project by learning the entire dance herself and performing it with Pavlova's assistant partner, Andreas Pavley.\\r\\nFrom New York to Paris\\r\\nThe daughter of English concert pianist Richard Hoffman, Malvina Hoffman grew up in New York City. Her artistic training began with drawing and painting, but after studying at the Art Students League and receiving helpful criticism from sculptors Herbert Adams (1858-1945) and Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), she decided to concentrate on sculpture. Traveling to Europe in 1910, she studied with Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) in Paris. To provide herself with a solid foundation in the art and craft of sculpture she took courses in dissection at the Cornell College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York and also learned the technology of casting, chasing, and patinating bronze. \\r\\nHoffman's interest in the ballet did not preclude production of works dealing with other subjects. She completed several public monuments and numerous portraits, which earned her an international reputation and led to her most ambitious project: the 1929 commission from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History for more than 100 life-size figures, heads, and busts representing the peoples of the earth.</td>\n",

The subject of this plaquette finds its origins in the ancient myth of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, a popular theme during the Renaissance. After killing his wife and child in a fit of rage, Hercules was sent by an oracle to be punished by King Eurystheus of Tiryns. The King presented Hercules with twelve challenges, the first of which was to kill the Nemean lion. Twice as large as a normal lion, it had an impenetrable hide, symbolic of the uncontrollability of nature. Hercules tracked the lion to its cave, and after failing to kill it with the arrows of Apollo, Hercules strangled the lion with his bare hands. As Hercules' strength allowed him to defeat the lion, the myth expresses human dominance over nature. Hercules then used the lion's razor-sharp claws to remove its skin and returned to King Eurystheus wearing the impenetrable skin as protection. To honor the lion's struggle against Hercules, Zeus transformed the lion into the constellation Leo. In this scene, the nude Hercules stands in profile facing left with his left foot resting on the plaquette's lower border. The plaquette has no background other than a barren tree against which rest Hercules's club and Apollo's quiver and bow. The lion rests its rear paw on Hercules' thigh as Hercules lifts the lion off of the ground. The lion's body and mane consists of stylized tufts of fur which contrast with the smooth, naturalistic form of Hercules' body. The minute, short curling lines of the hair and mane create a rhythmic effect while the smooth curves of the forms place an emphasis on contour-this contrast of visual rhythm with smooth form is in fact characteristic of Moderno's bronze relief sculpture. The composition meanwhile has its origin in ancient Greek coins as well as Renaissance cameos.</td>\n",

In early 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland organized an exhibition surveying Tunick's photographs in preparation for his June 26, 2004, installation in Cleveland. The shoot involved some 2,754 individuals-the largest installation in North America. For Ohio 4 (Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland), he posed just the men-all 1,387-kneeling in Voinovich Park, North Coast Harbor, at the end of East 9th Street.

This small bronze is likely a sculptural representation of the Wrath of Neptune from the Aeneid. During the Trojan War, Juno incited winds to sink Trojan ships. Infuriated by Juno's incursion into his domain of the sea, Neptune rides out in his chariot, saving the Trojan army and threatening to punish the winds for their insolence. The massive, muscular nude male figure stands upright on his seahorse-drawn chariot, twisting to face the wind. The turbulent waves and the windblown hair and beard of the figure give life to this small bronze. The figure's left hand would have originally held reins, while the right hand, which once held a trident, is outstretched in the act of commanding the waves to be still. This bronze was once attributed by art historian Wilhelm von Bode to Jacopo Sansovino based on its similarity to known works, such as the over-life-size marble figure of Neptune of the Scala di Giganti outside of the Doge's Palace in Venice. However, by 1921 Leo Planiscig had noted the CMA Neptune's similarity to bronzes and reliefs by Sansovino's pupil, Tiziano Minio, in the Loggetta at San Marco Square, Venice. In Minio's Jupiter on the Island of Candia for the Loggetta, the waves are represented with the same incised, undulating grooves as in this work. Neptune possesses the same stocky proportions and heavy musculature which was characteristic of Minio. The high polish and sweeping contours of the figure are characteristic of Sansovino, but the heightened drama of the subject display Minio's stylistic advancement from his teacher.</td>\n",

In 1770 Vallayer-Coster sought membership in the exclusive French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture with the submission of two still-life paintings, \"The Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture\" and \"The Attributes of Music.\" She was accepted with full rights and privileges to the overwhelmingly male academy-the only woman to be granted membership during this period independent of royal support or ties to a male academician. Denis Diderot, a French art critic and philosopher, responded to her submissions: \"It is certain that if all new members made a showing like Mademoiselle Vallayer's, and sustained the same high level of quality there, the Salon would look very different!\" Since women were officially barred during the 18th century from studying the male nude from life, still-life painting was among the few genres open to female painters. Garnering a reputation as a beautiful socialite who possessed the painting skills usually ascribed to male history painters, she was the only woman to enjoy the honor of lodging in the Louvre under the invitation of Marie Antoinette, who greatly admired her work. Marie Antoinette herself was present at the artist's 1781 marriage to Jean-Pierre-Silvestre Coster in the halls of Versailles. Despite the close associations with Antoinette and her administration, Vallayer-Coster survived the French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror in 1793. Many of her patrons were not so fortunate, and the artist's production virtually stopped until 1804, when François Dumont painted this miniature. During this period, Vallayer-Coster struggled to reestablish herself among the elite of Paris. Over the course of 1804, she exhibited two works at the Salon and had two works commissioned by Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Dumont's miniature depicts Vallayer-Coster holding a paintbrush in her right hand and a vase with flowers in her left, clearly an allusion to her skill as a still-life painter. Perhaps Vallayer-Coster requested that Dumont portray her as an artist in order to reassert her status as an important still-life painter. She may have intended to give the miniature to the empress in gratitude for her commissions and in the hope that there would be more to come. Her last major work, \"Still Life with Lobster\", was given to Louis XVIII and displayed at the Salon in 1817. Vallayer-Coster died in 1818 at the age of 74. Dumont worked closely with Marie Antoinette and, like Vallayer-Coster, grappled with diminished patronage after the queen's death and years of revolution. He attempted to reestablish his practice during the reigns of the Bourbon kings Louis XVIII and Charles X, but the competition provided by miniaturists like Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767-1855) proved too strong. Dumont's exquisite portrait of Vallayer-Coster was produced during a time when both artist and sitter had fallen from the limelight and were struggling to prove their enduring relevance in the new regime.

The railway represented a new convenience, but measures were needed to ensure the safety of other traffic. The numerous railway crossings included in the initial plans turned out to be a source of fatal accidents. To remedy the problem, the platforms and retaining walls were to be raised at the most dangerous spots. The Cours de Vincennes, in the eastern part of Paris, had been one of the deadliest intersections. The work on an elevated railway bridge over this street, which is depicted here, was completed in February 1889. Trouillebert concentrated on portraits until about 1881, when he began to focus on landscapes. He also painted everyday scenes and nudes. He was commissioned by Edme Piot, a public works contractor, to paint this and four related views of the Paris railway construction.</td>\n",

Brandt's work included social documentation, portraiture, landscape, and nudes. While in Paris during the late 1920s, his association with artists of the Surrealist movement helped shape his sensibilities. Alluding to that movement, Hellebrand made reference to the eye-a recurrent symbol in Surrealist art-by cropping one side of the sitter's face. She emphasized Brandt's surroundings as a means of identifying his artistic and intellectual pursuits. Although positioned at the edge of the image, the sitter's placement at the forefront and Hellebrand's use of intense light and shadow produced a wonderful field of depth. Brandt's somber, isolated, and perhaps introspective appearance is reinforced by the portrait's stark black-and-white tones.</td>\n",

During the course of a long career Rembrandt produced nine etchings of nudes, conducting a searching analysis of the feminine form. Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background. Its beauty is further enhanced by the beige-toned Japanese paper, which adds warmth and a special glow to the flesh. Understandably, this superb impression once belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire and Chatsworth, who formed one of the finest old master print collections still in private hands.</td>\n",
